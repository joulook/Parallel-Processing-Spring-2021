# Parallel Divide and Conquer Convex Hull

My 4th project was in the "Parallel Processing" course when I was in the 2nd semester of my master's at SUT. In this project I implemented a parallel convex hull calculation based on Map/Reduce paradigm in Java. This implementation is based on "A. M. Andrew. Another Eï¬€icient Algorithm for Conex Hulls in Two Dimensions, Info. Proc. Letters9, 216-219, 1979" paper.
